Working of Automatic Temperature Controlled Fan using Thermistor

It works on the principle of thermistor. In this circuit, PIN 3 (non-inverting terminal of op amp 741) is connected with the potentiometer and PIN 2 (inverting terminal) is connected in between of R2 and RT1 (thermistor) which is making a voltage divider circuit. Initially, in the normal condition the output of the op amp is LOW as the voltage at non-inverting input is lesser than inverting input which makes the NPN transistor remains in off condition. The transistor remains in OFF condition because there is no voltage applied to its base and we need some voltage at its base to make the NPN transistor conduct. Here we have used NPN transistor MJE3055 but any high current transistor can work here like BD140.
Non when the temperature is increased, the resistance of Thermistor deceases and the voltage at non-inverting terminal of op-amp becomes higher than the inverting terminal, so the op amp output PIN 6 will become HIGH and transistor will be ON (because when the output of op amp is HIGH the voltage will flow through the collector to emitter). Now this conduction of NPN transistor allows the Fan to start. As the thermistor return to the normal condition the fan will automatically turn OFF.
